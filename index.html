    <h1>Ramayana  The Legend
    </h1>
    <p>The Ramayana (रामायण) is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Mahabharata. It was composed by the sage Valmiki (वाल्मीकि) and consists of approximately 24,000 shlokas (verses) across 7 kāṇḍas (sections or books).

        It is not just a story—it's a dhārmika grantha (धार्मिक ग्रन्थ), a spiritual and moral compass that teaches dharma (धर्म – righteous duty), karma (कर्म – action), bhakti (भक्ति – devotion), and mārdava (मार्दव – humility).
        Explore the stories and values of the epic Ramayana through its most iconic characters.</p>
